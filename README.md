## Introduction
Netflix is an America subscription based streaming service that offers a wide variety of movies and TV shows. Netflix, along with similar platforms, have revolutionized how we consume movies and TV shows. Using the [Netflix TV Shows and Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv) from Kaggle, we can reveal patterns and trends in order to gain valuable insights of the data by utilizing SQL and Tableau. Acquired in July 2022, the data contains around 5k+ rows with 15 columns (genre, ratings, duration, seasons, etc) about the TV show and movie information and 77k+ rows for the credits of actors and directors on Netflix with 5 columns (id, name, role, etc).
